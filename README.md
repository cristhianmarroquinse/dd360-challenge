This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.
## Getting Started

The first step is install the dependencies (in my case I'm using NPM):

```bash
npm i
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can build and run the project with these commands:

```bash
#build you project
npm run build
#run your build
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
